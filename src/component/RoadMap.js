            Node Council Partners, also known as WONDERS, are 40 selected
            members who operate secured validating nodes for the WEMIX3.0
            mainnet.
          </p>
          <p>
            40 WONDERS are constituted by Technology Sponsors that contribute to
            the secure operation and innovation of WEMIX3.0, and Ecosystem
            Sponsors that contribute to the establishment of the experience
            cycle created through the on-chain/off-chain ecosystem via WEMIX3.0.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each NCP must stake 1.5M WEMIX, and the PMR (Permanent Minting
            Reward) is distributed automatically to NCP (40%), Stakers (10%),
            Eco fund (25%) and Maintenance (25%).
          </p>
          <p>
            WEMIX Grand Staking will become available to the community which
            will yield the 10% Staking Reward allocated through the PMR.
            However, staking participants for the WEMIX Grand Staking may not
            withdrawal from the staking pool prior to the implementation of
            Phase 2.

          <p>
            Upon Phase 2 launch, 1.5M fixed WEMIX Staking per validator node,
            which encourages active contribution of NCPs to the ecosystem, will
            be abolished and transformed into competitive staking.
          </p>
          <p>
            The initial distribution ratio of the PMR will be changed with the
            discontinuation of 10% staking reward allocated to WEMIX Grand
            Staking participants in Phase 2.
          </p>
          <p>The 40% PMR allocated as NCP reward will be increased to 50%.</p>
          <p>
            In doing so, WEMIX Grand Staking participants may then choose to
            delegate their stake volume to any of the 40 validator nodes,
            effectively increasing the chosen node's total staked shares above
            the median; generating increased reward rate for the node and
            community members that are participating in the delegation.
          </p>
          <p>
            This method will stimulate active participation of the community in
            the governance, but if any imposed action by the node operator is
            regarded as malicious or harmful to the ecosystem, the governance
            oversight program will confiscate total staked assets of the nodeâ€™s
            assets.
          </p>
          <p>
            This phase is expected to become operational within the first half
            of 2023, but may be adjusted in accordance to the state of WEMIX3.0

            Validator node operation by 40 selected authority partners known as,
            WONDERS, will be discontinued and the governance module will shift
            into an open & autonomous node participation system where anyone can
            become the validators of WEMIX3.0 based on staking volume.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on the total WEMIX staking volume per node, top 40 nodes will
            be periodically selected to validate transactions, transforming from
            an SPoA model into a PoS model.
          </p>
          <p>
            A slashing policy will be implemented to enforce fair operation of
            validator nodes, especially in the event of willful collusion
            against the interests of the ecosystem but also possible result of a
            misconfiguration of the node. Slashing will penalize the node by
            removing a portion of its existing stake and is irreversible.

            Democratized governance is completed at this stage, and the mainnet

          <p>
            WEMIX3.0 mainnet, developed on a decentralized architecture, will
            introduce a multi-phase democratized governance where the community
            is empowered to impact the 40 authority node governance structure
            through the introduction of a delegated staking module. This is the
            fundamental principle of the mainnet's roadmap, a means to
            illustrate true democratization through adoption of meritocracy
            based on contribution to the ecosystem.
